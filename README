I have implemented all three renderers, and an extra scene. 
I cannot implement a second creative scene and be able to render in each renderer and still turn in the assignment on time.

For the Sphere calculations I based it off of the code and article found here:
https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/minimal-ray-tracer-rendering-simple-shapes/ray-sphere-intersection

Most everything else is based off of the Scene class and other miscellaneous classes/objects within the project.
The pictures are in the base folder.

My development environment in case there are issues running the code:
Windows 10 Pro
i9 9900k
GTX 1070
IntelliJ running Java 8
Apache ant
