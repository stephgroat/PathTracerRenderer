The renderer ises several methods to achieve path tracing, with the two primary ones being a static depth limit.

The other method uses a russian-roulette termination algorithm that sets a probability for the paths to die,
and then adjusts the light calculated using the probability of the termination of each path in order to scale the light properly.
